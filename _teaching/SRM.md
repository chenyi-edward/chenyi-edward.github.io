This course provides a foundational introduction to management research methodology, beginning with the core principles of academic inquiry and the theoretical underpinnings of research. The curriculum guides students through the necessary steps for building sound management studies, including how to read and synthesize academic literature and how to properly utilize basic statistical concepts (such as probability, hypothesis testing, and correlation). A practical focus is placed on measurement and scale development. The course uses lectures, case discussions, and paper critiques to foster a rigorous scientific attitude and ensure students correctly understand and apply statistical knowledge in their own management research.
