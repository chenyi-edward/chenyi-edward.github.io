This study examines different types of interactions in online communities for e-commerce sellers. Drawing on social exchange theory and using machine learning techniques to differentiate individuals’ interactions in the online community, we examine the impact of exchanging two major types of resources—tangible assistance and knowledge—on e-commerce sellers’ online sales. The findings demonstrate that online sellers engaging in more interactions that involve receiving tangible assistance or knowledge tend to realize better online sales performance, while interactions involving providing tangible assistance or knowledge also may benefit sellers’ sales performance through increasing the receipt of resources. In addition, sellers more active in receiving knowledge tend to have higher sales in markets in which they face greater competition intensity. Our study contributes to both research and practice with a more nuanced understanding of interactions in online communities—that is, providing and receiving different types of resources—and their associated sales outcomes.
