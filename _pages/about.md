I am Dr. [Yi Chen](https://chenyi-edward.github.io/cv/), an Assistant Professor at the [School of Business and Management](http://en.sbm.shisu.edu.cn/ChenYi/list.htm) in [Shanghai International Studies University (SISU)](http://www.shisu.edu.cn).

My research sits at the dynamic intersection of Information Systems (IS), Organizational Behavior, and Data Science. I am driven by a passion to understand the intricate—and often counter-intuitive—ways that online interactions, digital platforms, social networks, and emerging technologies redefine individual behavior and corporate strategy.

Key Research Areas
------
[My work](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cBipuy0AAAAJ&hl=en) is unified by a central, critical question: How do we navigate the complex human and economic paradoxes created by digital platforms and novel technologies? Specifically, I'm interested in the following research areas:
- Online Interactions and Communities
- Online Labor Markets and Gig Platforms
- Social Networks and Social Media
- Generative AI (GenAI) and Emerging Technology Impact
- Information Systems (IS) Strategy and Digital Organizational Behaviors
